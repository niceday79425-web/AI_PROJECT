        "summary": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is a tech titan heavily invested in Artificial Intelligence. Despite unavailable current price data, its strategic position in AI, particularly amidst a global 'AI Spending Spree' by major tech firms, is a significant tailwind. Google's strong AI foundation, from Gemini to Google Cloud, positions it to both participate in and profit from the accelerating demand for AI infrastructure and services. Its extensive R&D and vast ecosystem provide a competitive moat for long-term growth."

        "summary": "Apple (AAPL) is a global tech leader with a strong ecosystem and financial resilience, driven by services growth. While the tech industry is buzzing with AI investments, Apple's AI strategy has historically focused on on-device, privacy-centric AI. The question remains how Apple will position itself in generative AI, with future software and hardware updates being crucial. The company faces challenges like market saturation and regulation but has opportunities in new products (like Vision Pro) and service expansion. The long-term investment thesis remains robust, but AI strategy is a key watchpoint."
